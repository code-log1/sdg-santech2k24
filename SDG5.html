            <h2>Empowering Women and Achieving Equality/h2>
            <p>Gender bias is undermining our social fabric and devalues all of us. It is not just a human rights issue; it is a tremendous waste of the world's human potential. By denying women equal rights, we deny half the population a chance to live life at its fullest. Political, economic and social equality for women will benefit all the worldâ€™s citizens. Together we can eradicate prejudice and work for equal rights and respect for all.</p>
